Mendel is an open source project. Although it has been no secret that there has been a work on v2, we were as transparent with our progress and tasks to be done.

Below are the things we need in order to achieve the Mendel v2 milestone.
- [ ] Finalize Outlet API for pluggability/extendability
- [ ] Implement Node module generator (creates module bundle separately from source)
- [ ] Implement Extract/[code split](https://twitter.com/samccone/status/797528710085652480) generator
- [ ] Manifest v1 Outlet
- [ ] File system outlet
- [ ] Make the Mendel development middleware communicate with cache, instead of manifest or FS, and resolve faster
- [ ] Parallelize GST
  - Create general class for multi-process workers
- [ ] CSS outlet with PostCSS support
- [ ] Improve test coverage (find the most effective way of testing; can be fully black box integrational test)
- More...
